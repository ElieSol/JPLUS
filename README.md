# JPLUS


Implemented for a Java Class Team Project (team of 2). 

JPLUS is a table game similar to chess, it's basically a biology version of chess with new components and rules.

There are 3 types of objects: Lipids, enzymes and metabolites.
The Lipids and enzymes are placed just like displayed on the figure. 
And metabolites are randomly place on the board and can change position during the game.

The rule for each player is to catch the higher number metabolites with their enzymes. The one who has the higher wins the game.
An other rule is that the player must use an enzyme of the same color than the metabolites he wants to catch. For example if he wants to catch a blue metabolites he must use a blue enzymes and so on.

There are still a lot of improvement to add to this game/app.
